REQUIREMENTS FROM JOB DESCRIPTION:

COMPANY RESEARCH (Use ONLY true facts from below; DO NOT hallucinate company details):
Summary: ${companyBrief.summary || 'Technology company'}
What They Do: ${companyBrief.what_they_do || 'Software and services engineering'}

GENERATION FOCUS FOR THIS SESSION:
${selectedAngle}

DYNAMIC TARGET DISTRIBUTIONS (Adapt based on candidate requirements and seniority; aim for roughly 20-30 total questions):
1. Technical / Core Domain (Target ~10-15 questions):
   - Must vary randomly between: conceptual, practical implementation, debugging, scenario-based, architecture, performance, and trade-offs.
2. Behavioural (Target ~5-7 questions):
   - Cover distinct soft-skills: teamwork, conflict resolution, ownership under pressure, handling failure/mistakes, continuous learning, tight deadlines, and stakeholder communication.
3. System Design / Domain Architecture (Target ~5-7 questions):
   - CRITICAL DISCIPLINE MATCHING:
     * For UI/UX / Product Designers: System Design MUST focus on Design System architecture, component tokenization, accessibility standards (WCAG AAA), responsive grid breakpoints, user flow diagrams, and design-to-code handoffs. DO NOT ask backend microservice, DB sharding, or Redis/Kafka questions for UI/UX Designers!
     * For Frontend Developers: Focus on client state management, Web Vitals performance, component breakdown, offline PWA storage, and Error Boundaries.
     * For Backend / Full-Stack / DevOps: Focus on system architecture, DB schema & query optimization, API routing, caching, and scalability appropriate for candidate seniority.
4. Company Fit (Target ~3-5 questions):
   - Base questions strictly on the true company research provided above. Ask how candidate experience aligns with their product domain, engineering challenges, and mission. DO NOT invent fictitious products or services.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR GENUINE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS:
- Phrase every question like a natural, top-tier interviewer (like ChatGPT or Google hiring managers).
- NEVER repeat experience duration strings (such as "3+ years of experience in...", "5 years in...", "minimum 2 years of...") inside question prompts. Focus purely on technical depth, scenarios, trade-offs, edge cases, and architectures.
- Every question MUST reference one or more requirement IDs in "requirement_ids" (e.g. ["r1"]).
- "category" must strictly be one of: "technical", "behavioural", "system-design", "company-fit".
- "difficulty": 1 (easy), 2 (medium), 3 (hard).
- Ensure high prompt diversity and zero repetitive wording.`;
